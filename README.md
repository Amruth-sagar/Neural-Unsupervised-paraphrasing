# Neural-Unsupervised-paraphrasing
Neural unsupervised Paraphrasing is one of the interest of the recent NLP researchers.
This research helps to use datasets which doesnâ€™t have human annotations and thus opens
a new direction in the field of paraphrasing. We have use pretrained BART to form pseudo
Ground truth and then perform an end to end supervised training of transformers from
scratch. We used four different corruption techniques and that makes our model more
robust.
